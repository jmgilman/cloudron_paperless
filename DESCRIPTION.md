[Paperless](https://paperless.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a digital document organizer that is designed to reduce the amount of paper documents you have. It consumes artifacts like PDF files and images, OCR's them, tags them, and then stores them into a database. Combined with a scanner, Paperless makes it possible to transfer all of your paper documents into an organized library that supports tagging and advanced searching. 

This app packages both the web front-end of Paperless as well as the document consumer. It supports uploading documents through the [Cloudron CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudron) tool, POST'ing using an app like [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/), or emailing to your app's configured email address. It also packages the REST API which provides access to programatically accessing your documents.
